# machine-learning-regression-using-iris-data-set
This contains a regression problem that is used to predict the class of a iris flower given the details of its petals and sepals.There are three classes.During the coding the classes are changed to 0,1,2.This is called encoding.I have used Python to implement this regression problem.
The test set can be used to test the program .
